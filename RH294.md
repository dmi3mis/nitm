# Configure the `python` command to run Python 3
# Note: this is non-standard behavior according to [PEP 394].
[student@workstation ~]$ alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3 


# Configure the `python` command to run Python 2
# Note: please review the support lifecycle of python2 before relying on it
[student@workstation ~]$ alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python2 

# Undo configuration changes and revert to the default (missing `python` command)
[student@workstation ~]$ alternatives --auto python

### 3. Implement playbooks

Write a simple Ansible playbook and run it to automate tasks on multiple managed hosts.

[Ansible Docs: YAML Syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html)

[Ansible Docs: Working With Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)

Acceptable boolean values:

- True  = true  = Yes = yes = 1
- False = false = No  = no  = 0

[Red Hat Ansible: Yes and No, True and False](https://chronicler.tech/red-hat-ansible-yes-no-and/)

|        TEST OUTCOME         |                 VARIABLE VALUE                   |

### 4. Manage variables and facts

Write playbooks that use variables to simplify management of the playbook and facts to reference information about managed hosts.

[Ansible Docs: Using Variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html)

[Ansible Docs: Variable precedence: Where should I put a variable?](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)

[Ansible Docs: Variables and Vaults](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#variables-and-vaults)

Best Practices to use Ansible Secret
>
>For general maintenance, it is often easier to use grep, or similar tools, to find variables in your Ansible setup. Since vaults obscure these variables, it is best to work with a layer of indirection. When running a playbook, Ansible finds the variables in the unencrypted file and all sensitive variables come from the encrypted file.
>A best practice approach for this is to start with a group_vars/ subdirectory named after the group. Inside of this subdirectory, create two files named vars and vault. Inside of the vars file, define all of the variables needed, including any sensitive ones. Next, copy all of the sensitive variables over to the vault file and prefix these variables with vault_. You should adjust the variables in the vars file to point to the matching vault_ variables using jinja2 syntax, and ensure that the vault file is vault encrypted.

Deploy, manage, and adjust files on hosts managed by Ansible.

### 7. Manage large projects

Write playbooks that are optimized for larger, more complex projects.

[Patterns: targeting hosts and groups](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_patterns.html)

| Description            | Pattern(s)                   | Targets                                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| All hosts              | all (or \*)                  |                                                     |
| One host               | host1                        |                                                     |
| Multiple hosts         | host1:host2 (or host1,host2) |                                                     |
| One group              | webservers                   |                                                     |
| Multiple groups        | webservers:dbservers         | all hosts in webservers plus all hosts in dbservers |
| Excluding groups       | webservers:!atlanta          | all hosts in webservers except those in atlanta     |
| Intersection of groups | webservers:&staging          | any hosts in webservers that are also in staging    |

[Ansible Docs: Controlling playbook execution: strategies and more](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.html)

Ansible strategies:
- [linear - Executes tasks in a linear fashion (default strategy)](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/strategy/linear.html)

  * Task execution is in lockstep per host batch as defined by serial (default all). Up to the fork limit of hosts will execute each task at the same time and then the next series of hosts until the batch is done, before going on to the next task.

- [free – Executes tasks without waiting for all hosts](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/strategy/free.html)
  * Task execution is as fast as possible per batch as defined by serial (default all). Ansible will not wait for other hosts to finish the current task before queuing more tasks for other hosts. All hosts are still attempted for the current task, but it prevents blocking new tasks for hosts that have already finished.
  * With the free strategy, unlike the default linear strategy, a host that is slow or stuck on a specific task won’t hold up the rest of the hosts and tasks.

- [debug – Executes tasks in interactive debug session](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/strategy/debug.html)
  * Task execution is ‘linear’ but controlled by an interactive debug session.
- [host_pinned – Executes tasks on each host without interruption](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/strategy/host_pinned.html)
  * Task execution is as fast as possible per host in batch as defined by serial (default all). Ansible will not start a play for a host unless the play can be finished without interruption by tasks for another host, i.e. the number of hosts with an active play does not exceed the number of forks. Ansible will not wait for other hosts to finish the current task before queuing the next task for a host that has finished. Once a host is done with the play, it opens it’s slot to a new host that was waiting to start. Other than that, it behaves just like the “free” strategy.

- [Mitogen for Ansible](https://mitogen.networkgenomics.com/ansible_detailed.html) is a completely redesigned UNIX connection layer and module runtime for Ansible. Requiring minimal configuration changes, it updates Ansible’s slow and wasteful shell-centic implementation with pure-Python equivalents, invoked via highly efficient remote procedure calls to persistent interpreters tunnelled over SSH. No changes are required to target hosts.

[Medium post: Difference between Forks and Serial in Ansible](https://medium.com/devops-srilanka/difference-between-forks-and-serial-in-ansible-48677ebe3f36)

[Ansible Docs: Delegation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation)
If you want to perform a task on one host with reference to other hosts, use the delegate_to keyword on a task

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  serial: 5

  tasks:
    - name: Take out of load balancer pool
      ansible.builtin.command: /usr/bin/take_out_of_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
      delegate_to: 127.0.0.1

    - name: Actual steps would go here
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: acme-web-stack
        state: latest

    - name: Add back to load balancer pool
      ansible.builtin.command: /usr/bin/add_back_to_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
      delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
```

[Ansible Docs: Including and Importing](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_includes.html#includes-vs-imports)

- All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
- All include* statements are processed as they are encountered during the execution of the playbook.

|                                        |     include_tasks include_role  | import_tasks import_playbook import_role |

| when happen                            | include when running play       | importing when initially parsed before any play run|
| tasks shows ansible-playbook --list-tasks | no | yes |

| Can i use ansible-playbook --start-at-task to start playbook with those types of task?| no  | yes |

### 8. Simplify playbooks with roles

Use Ansible roles to develop playbooks more quickly and to reuse Ansible code.
