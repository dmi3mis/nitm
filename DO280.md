#### Describing Cluster Operators




[What is an Operator?](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/operators)
An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes-native application. A Kubernetes-native application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tooling.

An Operator is essentially a custom controller.
A controller is a core concept in Kubernetes and is implemented as a software loop that runs continuously on the Kubernetes master nodes comparing, and if necessary, reconciling the expressed desired state and the current state of an object. Objects are well known resources like Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, or PersistentVolumes. Operators apply this model at the level of entire applications and are, in effect, application-specific controllers. 

The Operator is a piece of software running in a Pod on the cluster, interacting with the Kubernetes API server. It introduces new object types through Custom Resource Definitions, an extension mechanism in Kubernetes. These custom objects are the primary interface for a user; consistent with the resource-based interaction model on the Kubernetes cluster. 

An Operator watches for these custom resource types and is notified about their presence or modification. When the Operator receives this notification it will start running a loop to ensure that all the required connections for the application service represented by these objects are actually available and configured in the way the user expressed in the object’s specification.



[WHAT IS AN OPERATOR AFTER ALL?](https://operatorframework.io/what/)

An Operator represents human operational knowledge in software, to reliably manage an application. They are methods of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application.

The goal of an Operator is to put operational knowledge into software. Previously this knowledge only resided in the minds of administrators, various combinations of shell scripts or automation software like Ansible. It was outside of your Kubernetes cluster and hard to integrate. With Operators, CoreOS changed that.

Operators implement and automate common Day-1 (installation, configuration, etc) and Day-2 (re-configuration, update, backup, failover, restore, etc.) activities in a piece of software running inside your Kubernetes cluster, by integrating natively with Kubernetes concepts and APIs. We call this a Kubernetes-native application. With Operators you can stop treating an application as a collection of primitives like Pods, Deployments, Services or ConfigMaps, but instead as a single object that only exposes the knobs that make sense for the application.

[OpenShift Container Platform installation overview](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/architecture/architecture-installation.html)

Bootstrapping a cluster involves the following steps:
1.  The bootstrap machine boots and starts hosting the remote resources required for the master machines to boot. (Requires manual intervention if you provision the infrastructure)
2.  The master machines fetch the remote resources from the bootstrap machine and finish booting. (Requires manual intervention if you provision the infrastructure)
3.  The master machines use the bootstrap machine to form an etcd cluster.
4.  The bootstrap machine starts a temporary Kubernetes control plane using the new etcd cluster.
5.  The temporary control plane schedules the production control plane to the master machines.
6.  The temporary control plane shuts down and passes control to the production control plane.
7.  The bootstrap machine injects OpenShift Container Platform components into the production control plane.
8.  The installation program shuts down the bootstrap machine. (Requires manual intervention if you provision the infrastructure)
9.  The control plane sets up the worker nodes.
10.  The control plane installs additional services in the form of a set of Operators.

#### Introducing OpenShift Dynamic Storage

Pods use ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and logs. 
Issues related to the lack of local storage accounting and isolation include the following:
- Pods do not know how much local storage is available to them.
- Pods cannot request guaranteed local storage.
- Local storage is a best effort resource.
-   Pods can be evicted due to other pods filling the local storage, after which new pods are not admitted until sufficient storage has been reclaimed.

[Kubernetes Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) / [Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/) / [Storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/) / [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)

A _PersistentVolume_ (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual Pod that uses the PV. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

A _PersistentVolumeClaim_ (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany, see [AccessModes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)).

[Kubernetes Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) / [Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/) / [Storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/) / [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)

While PersistentVolumeClaims allow a user to consume abstract storage resources, it is common that users need PersistentVolumes with varying properties, such as performance, for different problems. Cluster administrators need to be able to offer a variety of PersistentVolumes that differ in more ways than just size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented. For these needs, there is the _StorageClass_ resource.

Authorization is managed using:
| Authorization object |Description | 
| - | - |
|Rules |Sets of permitted verbs on a set of objects. For example, whether a user or service account can `create` pods.
|Roles |Collections of rules. You can associate, or bind, users and groups to multiple roles.
|Bindings |Associations between users and/or groups with a role.


|Default cluster role | Description |
| ----- | - |
|`admin` |A project manager. If used in a local binding, an `admin` has rights to view any resource in the project and modify any resource in the project except for quota. |
|`basic-user` |A user that can get basic information about projects and users. |
|`cluster-admin` |A super-user that can perform any action in any project. When bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over quota and every action on every resource in the project.
|`cluster-status` |A user that can get basic cluster status information.
|`edit` |A user that can modify most objects in a project but does not have the power to view or modify roles or bindings.
|`self-provisioner` |A user that can create their own projects.
|`view` |A user who cannot make any modifications, but can see most objects in aproject. They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.

[RedHat KB: "oc logout is not working when logged in with system:admin" ](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4876851)

````
Resolution
system:admin is created automatically when the infrastructure is defined, mainly for the purpose of enabling the infrastructure to interact with the API securely.
By default system:admin uses certificate not the token to login to the cluster. Which mean system:admin doesn't have a password or token like other normal users have. When you try to logout from system:admin it will not get logged out.
Root Cause
system:admin credentials live in a client certificate data that can be seen in ~/.kube/config. If you get prompted for a password, that means your $KUBECONFIG file does not contain those credentials.

[OCP 4.5 Docs: Troubleshooting OpenShift SDN](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/sdn_troubleshooting.html)

The Interfaces on a Node
These are the interfaces that the OpenShift SDN creates:

-   `br0`: The OVS bridge device that containers will be attached to. OpenShift SDN also configures a set of non-subnet-specific flow rules on this bridge.
-   `tun0`: An OVS internal port (port 2 on `br0`). This gets assigned the cluster subnet gateway address, and is used for external network access. OpenShift SDN configures `netfilter` and routing rules to enable access from the cluster subnet to the external network via NAT.
-   `vxlan_sys_4789`: The OVS VXLAN device (port 1 on `br0`), which provides access to containers on remote nodes. Referred to as `vxlan0` in the OVS rules.
-   `vethX` (in the main netns): A Linux virtual ethernet peer of `eth0` in the Docker netns. It will be attached to the OVS bridge on one of the other ports.
![SDN Flows Inside a Node](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-3.11-Cluster_Administration-en-US/images/5484a5b9d1f394e368f0dfb6066165c1/SDN.png)

Depending on what you are trying to access (or be accessed from) the path will vary. There are four different places the SDN connects (inside a node). They are labeled in red on the diagram above.

-   **Pod:** Traffic is going from one pod to another on the same machine (1 to a different 1)
-   **Remote Node (or Pod):** Traffic is going from a local pod to a remote node or pod in the same cluster (1 to 2)
-   **External Machine:** Traffic is going from a local pod outside the cluster (1 to 3)

Of course the opposite traffic flows are also possible.

2.  [Edge](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html#secured-routes): the connection is encrypted from the client to the reverse proxy, but unencrypted from the reverse proxy to the pod.
3.  [Re-encrypt](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html#secured-routes): the encrypted connection is terminated at the reverse proxy, but then re-encrypted.
4.  [Passthrough](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html#secured-routes): the connection is not encrypted by the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy uses the [Server Name Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) (SNI) field to determine to which backend to forward the connection, but in every other respects it acts as a [Layer 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) load balancer.

For automating the certificate provisioning process, we are going to use three [operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/):
1.  [Cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager): this operator is responsible for provisioning certificates. It interfaces with the various CAs and brokers certificate provisioning or renewal requests. Provisioned certificates are placed into Kubernetes [secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). 
2.  [Cert-util-operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cert-utils-operator): this operator provides utility functions around certificates. In particular, it will be used to inject certificates into OpenShift routes and turn PEM-formatted certificates into java-readable keystores.
3.  [Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader): this operator is used to trigger a deployment when a configmap or secret changes. We are going to use it to restart our applications when certificates get renewed.
